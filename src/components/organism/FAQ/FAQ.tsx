    title: "What are ZK Rollups?",
    description:
      "ZK-Rollups are one of the options being developed for layer 2 construction to increase the scalability of Ethereum. All funds are held by a smart contract on the mainchain, while computation and storage are performed off-chain. The main idea is that instead of verifying each transaction separately, transactions are 'rolled up' to a single item (the rollup block), which is then being verified, approving all them simultaneously.",

    title: "What is zkSync?",
    description:
      "zkSync is a trustless protocol for scalable low-cost payments on Ethereum, powered by zkRollup technology. It uses zero-knowledge proofs and on-chain data availability to keep users' funds as safe as though they never left the mainnet.",
  },
  {
    title: "How can I start using ZigZag?",
    description:
      "To start using ZigZag, you will first have to connect your Web3 wallet to our application. Youâ€™ll then have to bridge funds over and activate your zkSync account, this includes a one-time transaction of roughly ~10$. To do so head over to ZigZag Bridge or zkSync bridge.",
