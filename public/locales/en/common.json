  "We offer extremely low slippage for trades of all sizes, quotes that compete with ones offered by centralized exchanges": "With our P2P system, users can trade against each other using a familiar order book model that replicates the user experience of centralised exchanges. Unlike AMM-style DEXs, market makers providing liquidity to the order books through limit orders don't necessarily suffer from impermanent loss. When you place or cancel an order, it doesn't use any gas as the process happens off-chain. However, when your order is matched with another person's order, then a swap transaction will occur on-chain.",
  "High Scalability": "ZK-Rollups",
  "By using ZK Rollups we are able to offer near-zero swap fees with nearly instantaneous transactions.": "ZigZag takes advantage of ZK-Rollup technology. By utilising this technology, users benefit from near-zero swap fees and nearly instantaneous transactions. \n\n ZK-Rollups increase the scalability of Ethereum. These Layer-2s allow for numerous off-chain transactions to be batched together and then recorded on-chain whilst still benefiting from optimal decentralisation and security from Ethereum's mainnet. \n\n This results in extremely high throughput, much faster transaction times and lower fees than if each transaction were done on-chain. This results in a capital efficient order book.",
  "Decentralized & Secure": "Competitive pricing",
  "ZigZag aims to be fully decentralized and open source.": "ZigZag provides excellent quotes to all users by using the order book model. Users can take advantage of real-time price feeds from major CEXs and on-chain oracle feeds like Chainlink and Uniswap which market makers utilise to place resting orders onto the protocol's order books.",
  "CEX Price Feeds": "Decentralised protocol",
  "All price feeds are fetched from centralized exchanges,  always guaranteeing the best price possible.": "ZigZag is committed to creating a fully community-owned decentralised exchange and has made great strides toward this goal. All code is public on GitHub and smart contracts are regularly audited by independent experts. There is no need to deposit or withdraw funds from your wallet with the protocol—allowing for trustless, non-custodial transactions.",

  "What is ZigZag?": "What is ZigZag?",
  "zigzag is a decentralized": "ZigZag is a decentralised, P2P, non-custodial exchange that uses ZK-Rollups to power its order book. With this innovative protocol, users can trade quickly and securely with extremely low fees. Plus, they will benefit from price quotes on par with centralised exchanges for all-size trades! \n\n ZigZag strives to create a decentralised exchange that replicates the user experience from existing centralised exchanges, while also benefiting from a non-custodial aspect with optimal liquidity.",
  "What are ZK Rollups?": "Why trade on ZigZag?",
  "zk-rollups are one of the options": "The order book DEX is designed to mimic the user experience of a centralised exchange, which will be familiar and easy to use for traders who are used to that type of platform. \n\n Users can trade directly from their wallets with no need to deposit or withdraw funds while remaining in full control of their assets. \n\n The price quotes available on ZigZag are the most competitive available on-chain as market makers extract price feeds from centralised exchanges and relay them to ZigZag's order books.",
  "What is zkSync?": "How can I start using ZigZag?",
  "zksync is a trustless protocol": "To start, simply click “Start Trading” at the top of the page, and connect your Web3-wallet to the application. For zkSync Lite you will need to bridge funds from Ethereum activate your account with a one-time transaction, of roughly $0.50. <1>Read the full guide!</1>",
  "How can I start using ZigZag?": "What's the difference between zkSync Lite and Era?",
  "To start using zigzag": "ZigZag Exchange is the first decentralised exchange built on an open ZK-Rollup chain (zkSync Lite). \n ZigZag is the first example of successful mass adoption on a ZK-Rollup which has led to its well-known name and reputation. \n\n Since zkSync Lite is not zkEVM, the infrastructure is limited. With zkSync Era (zkEVM), \n ZigZag will provide users with additional features and benefits, such as <1>liquidity pools</1>. \n A preview of ZigZag's zkSync Era DEX is currently live on Arbitrum mainnet. Read more about <2>ZigZag’s move to zkSync Era.</2>",
