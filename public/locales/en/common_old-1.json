  "What is ZigZag?": "What is ZigZag?",
  "zigzag is a decentralized": "ZigZag is a decentralised, P2P, non-custodial exchange that uses ZK-Rollups to power its order book. With this innovative protocol, users can trade quickly and securely with extremely low fees. Plus, they will benefit from price quotes on par with centralised exchanges for all-size trades! \n ZigZag strives to create a decentralised exchange that replicates the user experience from existing centralised exchanges, while also benefiting from a non-custodial aspect with optimal liquidity.",
  "What are ZK Rollups?": "Why trade on ZigZag?",
  "zk-rollups are one of the options": "The order book DEX is designed to mimic the user experience of a centralised exchange, which will be familiar and easy to use for traders who are used to that type of platform. \n Users can trade directly from their wallets with no need to deposit or withdraw funds while remaining in full control of their assets. \n The price quotes available on ZigZag are the most competitive available on-chain as market makers extract price feeds from centralised exchanges and relay them to ZigZag's order books.",
  "What is zkSync?": "How can I start using ZigZag?",
  "zksync is a trustless protocol": "To start, simply click “Start Trading” at the top of the page, and connect your Web3-wallet to the application. For zkSync 1.0 you will need to bridge funds from Ethereum activate your account with a one-time transaction, of roughly $0.50. Read the full guide!",
  "How can I start using ZigZag?": "What's the difference between zkSync 1.0 and 2.0?",
  "To start using zigzag": "ZigZag Exchange is the first decentralised exchange built on an open ZK-Rollup chain (zkSync 1.0). \n ZigZag is the first example of successful mass adoption on a ZK-Rollup which has led to its well-known name and reputation. \n Since zkSync 1.0 is not zkEVM, the infrastructure is limited. With zkSync 2.0 (zkEVM), \n ZigZag will provide users with additional features and benefits, such as <1>liquidity pools</1>. \n A preview of ZigZag's zkSync 2.0 DEX is currently live on Arbitrum mainnet. Read more about <2>ZigZag’s move to zkSync 2.0.</2>",
